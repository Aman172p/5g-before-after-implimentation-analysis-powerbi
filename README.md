## Problem statement

After the launch of 5G services, the company achieved strong revenue growth in key cities. However, overall revenue has declined, accompanied by a rise in unsubscribed users. Trends in Active Users, Monthly Active Users (MAU), and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) indicate declining engagement and potential churn risks.
Management requires a dashboard to monitor Revenue, Active Users, MAU, ARPU, and Unsubscribed Users in order to identify churn drivers, assess post-5G performance, and support data-driven actions to improve customer retention and long-term business stability

## Result and Conclusion

The post-5G rollout period reveals a mixed performance landscape. While the top five cities continue to drive 60% of total revenue, key revenue hubs like Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Patna, and Raipur are experiencing declining Monthly Active Users (MAU) and a rise in inactive and unsubscribed users. This signals potential customer churn risks and underscores the urgent need for targeted engagement strategies to safeguard market share.

Interestingly, Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) has increased by 11.05%, suggesting that current pricing strategies are extracting higher revenue from a smaller, active customer base. However, this also indicates that pricing may be a barrier to broader adoption, and a careful reassessment is required to balance customer retention with revenue growth.

Strategic Implications:

Implement targeted marketing campaigns to re-engage declining MAU in key cities.

Address the surge in unsubscribed users (UNU) to prevent reputational damage.

Reevaluate pricing strategies to optimize ARPU while minimizing customer attrition.

Develop a dual-focused approach: retain high-value customers while attracting new users in critical revenue markets.

Overall, this analysis highlights the need for a proactive, data-driven strategy to stabilize revenue, reduce churn, and ensure sustainable growth in the post-5G landscape.
